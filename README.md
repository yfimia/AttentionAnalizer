AttentionAnalizer
=================

Attention Analizer simulates human vision during the first 5 seconds of exposure to visuals, and creates heatmaps based on an algorithm that predicts what a real human would be most likely to look at.

Attention Analizer Dashboard offers designers and advertisers, a pre-testing service that measures the performance of your design, before it airs, by analyzing levels of attention, brand effectiveness and placement, as well as breaking down the flow of attention.
